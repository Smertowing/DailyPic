SwiftyRequest is an HTTP networking library built for Swift.

SwiftyRequest uses `URLSession` for the underlying transport. `URLSession` on Linux is not yet completely implemented so you may find that this library is less reliable on Linux than Darwin.

* [CircuitBreaker Integration](#circuitbreaker-integration)
* [Response Methods](#response-methods)

## Features
- Several response methods (e.g. Data, Object, Array, String, etc.) to eliminate boilerplate code in your application.
- JSON encoding and decoding.
- Integration with [CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CircuitBreaker) library.
- Authentication token.
- Multipart form data.

## Swift version
The 0.0.x releases were tested on macOS and Linux using the Swift 3.1 and 3.1.1 binaries.

The 1.x.x releases were tested on macOS and Linux using the Swift 4.0.3 and later.

*NOTE:* Because of issues with URLSession/URLRequest in Swift 4.0, Swift 4.0 projects should use the 0.0.x release of SwiftyRequest.

You can download this version of the Swift binaries by following this [link](https://swift.org/download/#releases).

## Installation
To leverage the SwiftyRequest package in your Swift application, you should specify a dependency for it in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
 import PackageDescription

 let package = Package(
     name: "MySwiftProject",

     ...

     dependencies: [
        // Swift 4.0
        .package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/SwiftyRequest.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.0")),
        // Swift 4.0.2 or newer
        .package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/SwiftyRequest.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")),
         ...

     ])
```

## Usage

### Make Requests
To make outbound HTTP calls using SwiftyRequest, You create a `RestRequest` instance. The `method` parameter is optional (defaulting to `.get`) and `url` is required

#### Below is the list of customizeable fields
- `headerParameters`
- `acceptType`
- `messageBody`
- `productInfo`
- `circuitParameters`
- `contentType` : Defaults to `application/json`
- `method` : Defaults to `application/json`

Example usage of `RestRequest`:

```swift
import SwiftyRequest

let request = RestRequest(method: .get, url: "http://myApiCall/hello")
request.credentials = .apiKey
```

### Invoke Response
In this example, `responseToError` is simply an error handling function.
The `response` object we get back is of type `RestResponse<String>` so we can perform a switch on the `response.result` to determine if the network call was successful.

```swift
request.responseString(responseToError: responseToError) { response in
    switch response.result {
    case .success(let result):
        print("Success")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failure")
    }
}
```

### Invoke Response with Template Parameters

In this example, we invoke a response method with some template parameters to be used in replacing the `{state}` and `{city}` values in the `url`. This allows us to create multiple response invocations with the same `RestRequest` object, but possibly using different url values. Additionally, the `RequestParameters` is a helper object to bundle up values used to create a `RestRequest` object.

```swift
let request = RestRequest(url: "http://api.weather.com/api/123456/conditions/q/{state}/{city}.json")
request.credentials = .apiKey

request.responseData(templateParams: ["state": "TX", "city": "Austin"]) { response in
	// Handle response
}
```

### Invoke Response with Query Parameters

In this example, we invoke a response method with a query parameter to be appended onto the `url` behind the scenes so that the `RestRequest` gets executed with the following url: `http://api.weather.com/api/123456/conditions/q/CA/San_Francisco.json?hour=9`. If no `queryItems` parameter is set, then all query parameters will be removed from the url if any existed.

```swift
let request = RestRequest(url: "http://api.weather.com/api/123456/conditions/q/CA/San_Francisco.json")
request.credentials = .apiKey

request.responseData(queryItems: [URLQueryItem(name: "hour", value: "9")]) { response in
	// Handle response
}
```

## CircuitBreaker Integration

SwiftyRequest now has additional built-in functionality for leveraging the [CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CircuitBreaker) library to increase your application's stability. To make use of this functionality, you just need to provide a `CircuitParameters` object to the `RestRequest` initializer. A `CircuitParameters` object will include a reference to a fallback function that will be invoked when the circuit is failing fast.

### Fallback
Here is an example of a fallback closure:

```swift
let fallback = { (error: BreakerError, msg: String) in
    print("Fallback closure invoked... circuit must be open.")
}
```

### CircuitParameters
We just initialize the `CircuitParameters` object and create a `RestRequest` instance. The only required value you need to set for `CircuitParameters` is the `fallback` (everything else has default values).

```swift
let circuitParameters = CircuitParameters(timeout: 2000,
                                          maxFailures: 2,
                                          fallback: breakFallback)

let request = RestRequest(method: .get, url: "http://myApiCall/hello")
request.credentials = .apiKey,
request.circuitParameters = circuitParameters
```

At this point, you can use any of the response methods mentioned in the section below.

## Response Methods
There are various response methods you can use based on what result type you want, here they are:

- `responseData` returns a `Data` object.
- `responseObject<T: Codable>` returns a Codable object of type `T`.
- `responseObject<T: JSONDecodable>` returns an object of type `T`.
- `responseArray<T: JSONDecodable>` returns an array of type `T`.
- `responseString` returns a `String`.
- `responseVoid` returns `Void`.
